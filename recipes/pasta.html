    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>If you're looking for a super simple, comforting, no-frills bowl of spaghetti and meatballs, you've come to the right place. And if you're feeling adventurous, it's also a great jumping off point for your own version of this classic dish!</p>
        <p>When it comes to sauce, you've got options. For an even speedier dinner, you can totally go with jarred marinara sauce. Or, if you've got some time on your hands, we love this simple Marcella Hazan-inspired spaghetti sauce. Feel free to try your own favorite herbs and spices, tasting as you go!</p>
